# <img src="https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services/raw/master/design/Logo.png" alt="Pip.Services Logo" style="max-width:30%"> <br/> Component Definitions for .NET

This framework is a part of [Pip.Services](https://github.com/pip-services/pip-services) project.
It defines components that can be used to implement non-trivial business logic in applications and services.

The key difference of this framework is a portable implementation across variety of different languages. 
Currently it supports Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, Golang. The code provides reasonably thin abstraction layer 
over most fundamental functions and delivers symmetric implementation that can be quickly ported between different platforms.

- **Auth** - credentials parameters and credential stores
- **Build** - component factories framework
- **Config** - configuration readers
- **Connect** - connection parameters and discovery services
- **Count** - performance counters
- **Info** - context information
- **Lock** - distributed locks
- **Log** - logging components
